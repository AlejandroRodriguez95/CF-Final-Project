# CF-Final-Project
Final project from CodeFactory


This is the final project from our web development course. We worked in a group of 5, and decided to use the php framework Symfony.
  Our project consists of a page where users can create their account, make, edit, delete posts (their own), read the news, and donate.  
  There is also a superadmin and an admin.     The superadmin can edit accounts through the system that we designed. The admin can edit posts from all users and accounts, but not create new admin accounts.
  
  How to run it:
  -install symfony dependencies (https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html)  
  -install and run xampp or any similar software that simulates a database system in your local machine  
  -add the database from the .sql file included in the zip file to your database system  
  -run the server (on my machine, the command is "php bin/console server:run"   
  -open your browser and go to localhost:8000 (or the chosen port)
